Mario jumped onto the screens and into the world's heart on July 9th 1981 in Donkey Kong's  Arcade Games release. Although originally going by the name 'Mr.Video' and shortly thereafter 'Jumpman' Mario would go on to cement his legacy as the worlds most iconic video game character and Nintendo's mascot. Created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, and taking inspiration from the likes of Popeye and King Kong.His appearance was created due to many design restrictions at the time. His moustache was the result of not being able to render a mouth with the limited graphics available and his hat was there as hair was difficult to animate! Mario was designed not only to be a hero to rescue the damsel in distress but also for Nintendo to hopefully break into the American market. He was a sucess at both! 
</p>
<p>
The Mario franchise is now the worlds largest and best selling video game franchise, spawning over 200 titles of varying genres; from the original platform games, to sports including golf and tennis and the fan favourite Mario Kart, Mario has sold more than 500 million copies!
</p>
<p>
During this period of time Mario has of course evolved. He has gone from the 8-bit character of the early 80's to a softer and rounder figure, and as processing power increased so did his character, and in 1996 with the launch of the fantastic Mario 64  video game audiences world wide was treated to a fully 3D Mario. Later the Wii and Wii U would refine this which is what has left us today we the Mario we all know and love.

		    					<p>Luigi is Mario's younger, taller twin brother and is a major protagonist of the Mario franchise, being second only to Mario. Throughout his life, he has lived in Mario's shadow, developing both cowardly and heroic tendencies. Despite this, Luigi has helped and fought alongside his brother on many occasions. Mario Bros. marks his first appearance in the Mario franchise and his debut in general. Originally a palette swap of Mario, Luigi was created to facilitate a second player option. Since the two-player mode was dropped from most main Super Mario games beginning with Super Mario Land, Luigi has gained his own identity and personality. This is especially noticeable in installments for the Luigi's Mansion and the Mario & Luigi series of games.</p>

		    					<p>Princess Peach (casually Peach, formerly Princess Toadstool outside of Japan prior to Super Mario 64) is a main character in the Mario franchise, and the princess of Mushroom Kingdom. Peach first appeared in Super Mario Bros. and was created by Shigeru Miyamoto to be the damsel-in-distress throughout most Mario games. She resides in her castle along with many Toads, who act as her loyal servants. Her kingdom is often attacked by the Koopa Troop, a group led by Bowser. She is the love interest of Mario.</p>

		    					<p>Toad is a character who is Princess Peach's attendant and a long time protector of the Mushroom Kingdom. He is actually a singular character among an entire species of look-alikes (much like Yoshi is to the Yoshi species), leading to confusion over some of his appearances. He usually has the role of a supporting character who tries to help Mario and Luigi on their adventures, although he occasionally has been a main protagonist, such as in Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario 3D World, and his starring role in Wario's Woods. He also appears regularly as a playable character in the Mario spin-offs. His role as Peach's steward has sometimes instead been given to Toadsworth.</p>

		    					<p>Yoshi (sometimes specified as Green Yoshi) is one of the heroes of the Mario franchise, an ally of Mario and Luigi, and the protagonist of his own franchise. He is a member of the Yoshi species and has aided his brethren in saving their homeland on multiple occasions. In his youth, Yoshi managed to rescue and protect Baby Mario and Baby Luigi from the wrath of Kamek and the Koopa Troop. According to Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Yoshi is one of the few members of his species who can speak the language of the other characters, though it seems that this is not his first language, since, as in other games, his statements are translated through parentheses. In the Mario franchise, he is a major character and often acts as a steed for Mario and other protagonists, while in most of the Mario sports and party games, he is a playable character on his own.</p>
