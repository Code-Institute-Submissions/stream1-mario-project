Mario jumped onto the screens and into the world's heart on July 9th 1981 in Donkey Kong's  Arcade Games release. Although originally going by the name 'Mr.Video' and shortly thereafter 'Jumpman' Mario would go on to cement his legacy as the worlds most iconic video game character and Nintendo's mascot. Created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, and taking inspiration from the likes of Popeye and King Kong.His appearance was created due to many design restrictions at the time. His moustache was the result of not being able to render a mouth with the limited graphics available and his hat was there as hair was difficult to animate! Mario was designed not only to be a hero to rescue the damsel in distress but also for Nintendo to hopefully break into the American market. He was a sucess at both! 
</p>
</br>
<p>
The Mario franchise is now the worlds largest and best selling video game franchise, spawning over 200 titles of varying genres; from the original platform games, to sports including golf and tennis and the fan favourite Mario Kart, Mario has sold more than 500 million copies!
</p>
</br>
<p>
Mario then began the Super Mario Bros series in 1985 on the NES. This series is his biggest outing and has resulted in over 310 million sales world wide, which makes it the best selling video game series of all time! The series has had at least one release on every console and handheld Nintendo have released since. 
</p>
</br>

<p>
During this period of time Mario has of course evolved. He has gone from the 8-bit character of the early 80's to a softer and rounder figure, and as processing power increased so did his character, and in 1996 with the launch of the fantastic Mario 64  video game audiences world wide was treated to a fully 3D Mario. Later the Wii and Wii U would refine this which is what has left us today we the Mario we all know and love. 
</p>
</br>
<p>
    His story usually revolves around Princess Peach being kidnapped by Bowser, sometimes referred to as King Koopa, and his quest through the Mushroom Kingdom to resue her and bring her back to her castle. During the course of these adventures Mario encounters all sorts of enemies and allies alike. His early efforts always end up unfruitful as each captured castle will result in Toad informing Mario that the Princess is indeed in another castle! As he goes from world to world capturing castles he passes through many different enviroments and collects an array of power ups!
